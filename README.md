# Creative Brief

#### Client: GoodReads

#### First Impression:
I created an account on Goodreads. Here's my experience and first impressions:
There were several login options (+). I logged in through Amazon. I expected to be able to get in and start using the service... but then it asked me to create a new loging again for Goodreads! (-) A big minus... cause this just defeated the purpose of logging in through Amazon. I then selected categories and it pulled all my books in from Amazon and asked me to rate them. It then gives me recommendations based on my ratings and the categories i selected. But there was one big problem... cause all their recommendations (history, fiction, etc) were all related to childrens books!! (-)

Algorithm seems very messed up. Website is cluttered and unorganised. Recommendations were useless. Bookshelf is very busy. The UI is not pretty and the UX is seriously lacking!

#### SWOT:
##### Strengths:
- Has many members already.
- Has a large library.
- Can view friends bookshelves
- Bookshelves, reviews and ratings are public
- Recommendations based on past history

##### Weaknesses:

##### Opportunities:
